Armed combat, which is fighting with weapons, is performed by military organizations. When political communities within the same cultural unit engage in warfare, this is considered to be internal war. p. 143: If there is more than one military organization within a political community, and these ... engage in armed combat, this is considered feuding or civil war, depending on the scope of the conflict.

Otterbein (1970) also had difficulty coding this attribute because of such an assumption. Therefore, I do not consider my quantitative results on defense to be reliable. Otterbein made one useful distinction that I could not implement satisfactorily. He coded the military expectations in order of importance -- first, second, third.
