Now, societies for which code was ""not different than later years"" have this information spelled out, using detailed codes of Gray's v12, which describes the pattern of marital residence in later years. Note also that two codes were added for ""Uv"" and ""Vu"" based on Murdock's note under the Ambilocal code. Specifically: ""The symbols Uv or Vu are used to denote, respectively, a marked preponderance of uxorilocal or virilocal practice [in ambilocal residence]. That is, cases of ambilocal residence where the actual frequency of uxorilocal vs. virilocal residence exceeds the other by a ratio greater than two to one. ","Codes for ""first years"" in Murdock do not include options for Matrilocal/Patrilocalï¾…it is not clear if these are contained in Uxorilocal/Virilocal. In the case of the ""Marital residence (prevailing pattern)"" variable Matrilocal/Patrilocal are distinguished by Uxorilocal/Virilocal (with the latter being ""confined to instances where the wife's [husband's] matrikin [patrikin] are not aggregated in matrilocal and matrilineal [patrilocal and matrilineal] kin groups"".

Armed combat, which is fighting with weapons, is performed by military organizations. When political communities within the same cultural unit engage in warfare, this is considered to be internal war. p. 143: If there is more than one military organization within a political community, and these ... engage in armed combat, this is considered feuding or civil war, depending on the scope of the conflict.

Otterbein made one useful distinction that I could not implement satisfactorily. He coded the military expectations in order of importance -- first, second, third.
